You need to modify and update the infomation based on what your credentials are when setting up Bluemix, so:
	- in MainActivity.java, in PostClientControlLed method you need to update your device name/id and access token from Spark
	- sparkled.properties needs to be updated with information from Bluemix's Node-Red app that you've created and attached 
		to it the Mobile Application Security which means collect info from Mobile options on the right side from your app's
		link on your Dashboard.
