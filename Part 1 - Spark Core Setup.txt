Part 1 - Spark Core:
You need to create an account with https://spark.io to connect your Spark Core device to Web IDE. It's better to be familiar with Spark related subjects to be able to connect and flash your spark core.
You can write code on https://build.spark.io/build/new. Basically, copy/paste the code in Spark Core/sparkled.ino into the Web IDE, compile and then flash it into your device.
In order for you to connect your Spark Core to the WiFi network, there are 2 ways for doing that (http://docs.spark.io/start/):
1) you can download Spark Core app, sign in, type SSID and password to connect to the WiFi, then it will find your device. Name it or keep what by default is named.
2) you can use putty.exe for Windows (download it from putty.org) and choose Serial radio button and make sure to write the correct COM port and click OK.
	While Putty doesn't display anything yet, just press w on your keyboard and type SSID, then password and the device will be connected.
	
*To note that the code for Spark core states D0 to write On or Off commands. Place the LED at D0 and GND.
